Spring JavaFX Tinyapp
=====================

This is a sample application that demonstrates how JavaFX and Spring can integrate.

## Building

Building it with maven will require to have JavaFX in your classpath. The Zen Java JavaFX plugin [1] can do this for you.

   mvn clean install


You can then run the application by executing

    mvn exec:java
